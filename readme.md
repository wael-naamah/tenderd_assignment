# Tenderd Senior Frontend Engineer Assignment 

ðŸŽ‰ Thank you for your interest in joining the **Tenderd** team!

In this assignment, you will embark on a journey of three challenges, with each one building upon the previous challenge, showcasing your skills as a Senior Frontend Engineer.

ðŸ“Œ **_Important:_** Please ensure that each challenge is treated as a separate, standalone project. This means we should be able to run each challenge effortlessly by using the following commands:
- `npm install && npm start` for installing dependencies and starting the project.
- `npm test` for running the test cases.

For your convenience, we have provided a sample `unit.test.js` file for each challenge. Feel free to use a different testing framework if that's what you prefer. Note that this file is just as example, creating an actual running test suite is part of the assignment and we expect you to add additional test cases.

ðŸŒŸ Completing this project using **TypeScript** and **Functional Components** will earn you bonus points! ðŸŒŸ

> **_NOTE:_** Our primary focus will be on code **readability**, **reusability**, and **maintainability**. Good luck, and we're excited to see your solutions! ðŸš€

As a final step, please fill in the short questionnaire that can be found in `survey.md`
